  Alterhash Project (aka xDAG16r), a Memory Hard and ASIC resistant POW hashing algorithm<br>
</h1>
This repo proposes the Alterhash ASIC resistant algo as a substitute for x16rV2.
This repo contains a code fork of Ravencoin in order to create a sandbox alternate testnet for the community to get mining working and test the performance.

Watch this page for additional updates and pointers to hosted servers and mining software.  Until then, assume nothing is working yet.
